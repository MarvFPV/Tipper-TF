- low profile
- choc v1
- central rotary encoder
- angled hands
- splayed columns
- variable height on outer colum. Can be adjusted by a combination of pinheaders(1.27mm pitch, 1mm or 1.5mm height) + (at the moment) 0.8mm spacer pcbs.
- BLE
- case files are supplied

## all files are considered untested prototypes, please don't use them to make your own board just yet. 
At the minimum there is a mismatch between pcb outlines and the case files. pcb needs some small fixes, too

### firmware
